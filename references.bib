abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of measured racing lines with a three-phase cornering sequence based on path primitives of straights, constant radius arcs and clothoids. Cornering maneuvers performed by professional racecar drivers in two cars at the limits of handling are analyzed by means of a curve tting algorithm that reduces path data into a minimal set of parameters. The results show that the considered set of path primitives can describe entry and cornering with accuracy comparable to the driver's envelope of the maneuver for unobstructed laps, however deviations between the fitted curves and measured racing lines were slightly greater for corner exit. The proposed method can thus be employed to quantify differences in driving style and cornering approach.},
