      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{Collected, compiled, analyzed, and openly published vehicle dynamics data from highly-skilled professional race car drivers during live racing events to gain insights into vehicle control at the limits of handling. Compared human performance with autonomous vehicles to improve operating capabilities of active vehicle safety systems.}
        \item {Implemented autonomous vehicle control using drive-by-wire hardware and convex optimization software to operate at the handling limits while following a desired trajectory. Implemented and tested control algorithms on experimental vehicles using C and MATLAB.}
        \item {Pioneered a comprehensive, noninvasive vehicle instrumentation suite for vintage race cars with significant historical value.}
        \item {Developed a graphical user interface in MATLAB for vehicle data visualization and exploratory data analysis.}
        \item {Assembled and maintained an end-to-end solution from surveyed GNSS base stations to on-board integrated navigation systems enabling research vehicles to operate reliably with centimeter-level position measurement accuracy. Installed and operated a Linux-based NTRIP caster to broadcast Differential GNSS corrections from multiple servers to multiple clients.}
