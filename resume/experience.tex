      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Collected, compiled, analyzed, and openly published vehicle dynamics data from highly-skilled professional race car drivers during live racing events to gain insights into vehicle control at the limits of handling.}
        \item {Compared behavior of highly-skilled human drivers with autonomous vehicles to improve operating capabilities of active vehicle safety systems.}
        \item {Implemented autonomous vehicle control using drive-by-wire hardware and convex optimization software to operate at the handling limits while following a desired trajectory. Implemented and tested control algorithms on experimental vehicles using C and MATLAB.}
        \item {Pioneered a comprehensive, noninvasive vehicle instrumentation suite for vintage race cars with significant historical value.}
        \item {Assembled and maintained a mobile GNSS base station to provide Differential GNSS corrections to the lab's research vehicles. Installed and operated a Linux-based NTRIP caster to broadcast DGPS corrections from multiple base station servers to multiple clients.}
