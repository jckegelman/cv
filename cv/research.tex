\cvsection{Research Interests}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I investigate how we can learn from highly-skilled race car drivers to make automated vehicles safer.
I explore how human control techniques at the limits of handling can be adapted into algorithms for autonomous vehicles.
I can contribute a deep understanding of vehicle dynamics and controls with practical experience and a great appreciation that all models are wrong, but some are useful.
